# AI 4 - Advanced
AI 4 is the advanced level of our AI Development Courses, building off of what students learned in the Intermediate AI 3 class they will learn to build their own neural network based AI models using the python programming language and PyTorch one of several tools used in creating and training modern AI, in order to create several small projects each with their own small AI model. 

AI 4 focuses on giving students a strong understanding of some of the additional systems and ideas that laid the groundwork for modern AI models, from the theory of how text transformers and images diffusers works, to exploring different variations of how we can build neural network to better interpret different types of data, as well as learning about and experimenting with different methods for training AI models. 

A student who succeeds in AI 4 will have a solid understanding of many the underlying ideas modern AI are expanded from and will be well on their way to learning how to eventually work on modern AI models.

# Instructional Method
Students participate in Live Virtual Sessions through a video program called Zoom.
These sessions are the primary form of learning, where an instructor guides the student
through the course material. Our class sizes are limited to a maximum of 4 students per
instructor and take place between 1-2 hours once per week at a scheduled time and
Day.

Students also have access to our online resources through RP4Kâ€™s Canvas Portal.
Extra material in the form of quizzes, discussions, assignments, and other materials are
provided for additional learning outside of the Live Virtual Sessions. Previous course
recordings are uploaded and students can participate in class discussions or contact the
instructor with any questions they may have.


# Additional Notes:
**Installation needs to happen before the course starts.**
Please ensure that the student has the template installed and to keep GitHub desktop installed in case students would like to work in groups. Follow the installation guide below to get started and reach out if you have any questions at [our email info@realprogramming.com](mailto:info@realprogramming.com)!
